        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Justin, a pre-med student passionate about science, healthcare, and community service. 
            I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and Data Science at Northeastern University. 
            With experiences in research, clinical care, and public health advocacy, I’m dedicated to improving healthcare access 
            and reducing disparities. In my free time, I enjoy skiing, playing tennis, attending live music events, 
            and exploring mindfulness practices. Whether I’m volunteering, learning new skills, or enjoying my hobbies, 
            I strive to make meaningful connections and positively impact those around me.
        </p>
