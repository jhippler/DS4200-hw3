        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Justin, a pre-med student passionate about science, healthcare, and community service. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and Data Science at Northeastern University, where I've combined my interests in both the hard sciences and the broader public health landscape. My academic background has provided me with valuable skills in data analysis, research design, and clinical knowledge, all of which I aim to use to improve healthcare access and reduce disparities.
            Through my experiences in research, clinical care, and public health advocacy, I have developed a strong commitment to understanding the complex factors that shape healthcare outcomes. I've worked in multiple research settings, from studying cell differentiation in C. elegans to exploring the behavioral effects of oxidative stress. These projects honed my problem-solving skills and reinforced my appreciation for the collaborative nature of scientific discovery.
            On the clinical side, my role as a Clinical Care Technician in the Cardiovascular Center at Tufts Medical Center has allowed me to provide hands-on care to patients while working alongside nurses and healthcare professionals. This experience has deepened my understanding of patient care, communication, and empathy in medical environments. Additionally, my involvement as a Link Health Ambassador allowed me to support individuals navigating complex federal benefit programs, strengthening my desire to advocate for underserved populations.
            Outside of academics and healthcare, I’m actively involved in my community through Phi Delta Epsilon, where I’ve participated in service initiatives and worked to foster meaningful connections with peers. As a co-founder and vice president of PeerLab Tutoring, I've led outreach efforts to establish global tutoring programs, promoting educational equity in underserved communities.
            In my free time, I enjoy skiing, playing tennis, attending live music events, and exploring mindfulness practices. Whether volunteering, learning new skills, or spending time with friends, I strive to make meaningful connections and positively impact those around me. I believe that combining my passion for science with my dedication to serving others will allow me to contribute to a more equitable and compassionate healthcare system.
